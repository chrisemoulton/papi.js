PAPI Webapp example
======================================

## Setup
1. ```npm install```
2. ```gulp```

Default port is 3333


## TODO:

browserify is cool.. but perhaps we need gulp or something, because,
we need it to mkdir build/, watch for file changes, as well run a web
server to host the files..

.. look at ng-pressilla......
